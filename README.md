# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

**Stop copying from chat. Start collaborating with AI.**

I built Nova for myself because copy-pasting between ChatGPT and Obsidian was killing my writing flow. Every feature exists because I hit that exact friction in my own work. I'm sharing it as my passion project for the Obsidian community.

Nova transforms AI from a chat interface into a true collaborative writing partner that directly edits, enhances, and creates content in your documents through natural conversation.

## üåü What Makes Nova Different

**Direct Document Editing**: Unlike other AI tools that make you copy-paste suggestions, Nova edits your documents directly where you write.

**Native Obsidian Integration**: Nova feels like part of Obsidian, not an add-on. I obsessed over the details - from using `[[]]` autocomplete to matching Obsidian's design language and keyboard shortcuts. Everything just works the way you'd expect.

**Privacy-First**: Choose between local AI (completely private) or cloud providers using your own API keys. Your data, your choice.

**Everything Free**: All features are available to everyone with their own API keys. No artificial restrictions, no feature gates.

**Works Everywhere**: Identical full-featured experience on desktop and mobile - only the AI provider setup differs by platform.

**Community-Supported**: Optional Supernova supporters get early access to new features and help sustain development.

   - **Claude**: Get API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - **OpenAI**: Get API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - **Google**: Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
4. **LM Studio users**: The Ollama provider works with LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible server

### 3. Start Writing
1. **Open any document** in Obsidian
2. **Click the Nova star** ‚≠ê in the sidebar
3. **Ask for help**: "Add an introduction explaining why this topic matters"
4. **Watch Nova edit directly** in your document - no copy-paste needed, no learning curve, just natural writing assistance that feels like Obsidian magic

### 4. Pro Tips

## üîí Privacy & Security

**Your Data, Your Choice**:
- **Local AI**: Use Ollama for complete privacy - nothing leaves your device
- **Cloud AI**: Use your own API keys - Nova never sees your content
- **No Analytics**: Nova doesn't track your usage or collect data
- **Transparent**: Open-source under AGPL-3.0 license

**Privacy Indicators**:
- Clear visual status indicators show whether you're using local or cloud AI
- Sidebar header displays current provider type and name
- No data transmission without explicit user action

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Obsidian**: v1.0.0 or newer
- **AI Provider**: 
  - **Desktop**: Nova ships with Ollama as the default (no API key required for complete privacy)
  - **Mobile**: Requires a cloud provider API key (Claude, OpenAI, or Google) - local AI not available on mobile
- **Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android

**For privacy-conscious users**: Nova defaults to Ollama for local AI that never leaves your device. The Ollama provider also works with LM Studio and other OpenAI-compatible local servers.

**For mobile users**: You'll need at least one cloud provider API key since local AI models cannot run on mobile devices.
