# Nova - Your AI Writing Partner for Obsidian

I built Nova because I was tired of copying and pasting between ChatGPT and my notes.

Nova solves this with precise AI editing - select text and right-click, or use chat commands that edit exactly at your cursor. No more guessing, no more copy-paste chaos.

**‚ú® AI edits exactly where you want**  
**üîí Privacy-first with local AI or your own API keys**  
**üÜì Every feature free forever with your API keys**

## üéØ The Problem Every Writer Knows

**Before Nova (Every Other AI Tool):**
- User: "Improve this paragraph"
- AI: *Makes edit somewhere, hopefully in the right place*
- User: "Wait, where did it put that? Let me find it and move it..."
- Result: **Constant copy-paste frustration and guesswork**

**With Nova:**
- **Selection**: *Select text ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "Improve Writing"*
- **Cursor**: *Type "Add conclusion here" ‚Üí AI writes exactly at cursor*
- Result: **Surgical precision, zero copy-paste**
