# Nova – Your Writing Partner That Actually Understands Where Ideas Belong

**The first AI that transforms your thoughts exactly where you think them.**

Stop fighting with AI about where your edits should go. Nova reads your mind through your cursor – select any text, and watch it transform in place with streaming magic that turns writing into thinking out loud.

✨ For writers who refuse to compromise on precision  
🎯 Every edit lands exactly where you intend  
🔒 Your thoughts stay yours — local AI or your own keys, your own rules  
🆓 Every writing feature becomes free forever, with paid supporters receiving early access to new features

Nova isn’t just an AI assistant — it’s invisible writing infrastructure. It vanishes so your ideas can flow.

## The Writing Problem Everyone Accepts (But Shouldn’t)

Every writer knows this frustration:

**You**: “Make this paragraph more academic”  
**AI**: Edits something, somewhere, maybe the right thing  
**You**: “Wait, where did it put that? Let me hunt through the response…”

This isn’t writing. This is wrestling with technology.

Nova solves the problem every other AI tool ignores: you shouldn’t have to guess where your edits will land.

## How Nova Changes Everything

### Select. Transform. Continue.

Your new writing workflow is impossibly simple:

1. Select any text in your document  
2. Right-click → Choose your transformation  
3. Watch it change exactly in place with streaming magic  
4. Keep writing like the AI was never there

No chat windows. No copy-paste chaos. No hunting for edits.

Just pure writing flow.

Prefer to write from scratch? Just place your cursor and say what you want.  
Nova understands your intent and writes exactly where you're thinking — no chatbox, no distractions.

### Writing That Feels Like Thinking

**Before Nova**: Interrupt your flow → Copy text → Switch to AI → Hope it understands → Copy result back → Find where it goes → Fix formatting → Resume writing (if you can remember what you were thinking)  
**With Nova**: Highlight text → Watch it improve in real-time → Continue your thought

The difference isn’t just smoother — it’s transformational.

## The Magic Behind the Simplicity

### Surgical Precision

Nova doesn’t guess where you want edits. You select exactly what needs work, and that’s exactly what transforms. Revolutionary selection-based editing means 100% accuracy, every time.

### Streaming Consciousness

Watch your ideas evolve in real-time. Nova streams transformations letter-by-letter, so you see your thoughts taking shape. It feels less like using AI and more like thinking with enhanced clarity.

### Context That Understands Documents

Nova knows about document structure, headings, and flow. Chat with cursor precision: “Add a methodology section here” and Nova writes exactly at your cursor with perfect formatting.

### Writing Craft Infrastructure

Commands become your personal writing tools. Create `/verse-study` for biblical analysis. Build `/character-profile` for fiction development. Transform Nova into your domain-specific writing partner.

This isn’t just AI assistance. It’s writing craft amplification.

## Privacy That Matches Your Principles

**Local AI First**: Use Ollama or LM Studio – your documents never leave your computer. Perfect for sensitive research, confidential writing, or simply preferring complete privacy.

**Your Keys, Your Control**: Cloud AI uses YOUR keys – Claude, OpenAI, Gemini. Nova never sees your content, never stores your conversations.

**Zero Analytics**: No tracking, no usage analytics, no “telemetry.” What you write stays between you and your chosen AI provider.

*Privacy-first writing for people who chose Obsidian for the same reason.*

## Where Nova Is Headed
