## 🎯  The Nova Difference

### **Surgical Precision**

- **Other AI tools:** "Edit this" → _guesses where to put changes_
- **Nova:** Select text → Transform exactly in place

### **Zero Copy-Paste Workflow**

- Chat at cursor position → AI writes exactly there
- Multi-document context with drag-and-drop
- Native Obsidian integration (feels built-in)

### **The Workflow Revolution**

**Before Nova:** Copy prompt → Switch to ChatGPT → Hope it edits the right part → Copy back → Find where it goes → Fix formatting

**With Nova:** Select text → Right-click → Watch it transform in place ✨
