2. Select your preferred provider from the dropdown
3. Enter your API key in the corresponding field
4. Test the connection by starting a conversation

#### 2. Understanding Nova's Core Philosophy

Nova operates on a **direct editing** principle:
- ‚úÖ **Selection-based editing**: Right-click selected text for quick transformations
- ‚úÖ **Cursor-based chat**: AI writes exactly at your cursor position
- ‚úÖ **Streaming updates**: See text appear in real-time as AI generates it
- ‚ùå **No copy-paste workflow**: Nova edits your document directly

#### 3. Your First Edit

**Try this quick example:**
1. Write a sentence in any note: "The cat sat on the mat."
2. Select the text
3. Right-click and choose "Improve Writing"
4. Watch Nova enhance it in real-time

---

## Selection-Based Editing

Selection-based editing is perfect for quick transformations of existing text. Simply select any text and right-click to access Nova's transformation menu.

### The Five Core Transformations

#### 1. **Improve Writing**
- **Purpose**: Makes text clearer, more concise, with better flow
- **Best for**: Rough drafts, unclear sentences, verbose writing
- **Example**: 
  - Original: "The thing that I wanted to say is that the meeting was not very productive"
  - Improved: "The meeting was unproductive"

#### 2. **Make Longer**
- **Purpose**: Expands ideas with more detail and examples
- **Best for**: Brief notes that need elaboration, outline expansion
- **Example**:
  - Original: "Exercise is good for health"
  - Expanded: "Regular exercise provides numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular function, stronger bones and muscles, better mental health through endorphin release, and enhanced immune system function that helps prevent disease"

#### 3. **Make Shorter**
- **Purpose**: Condenses text to essential points
- **Best for**: Long paragraphs, wordy explanations, summary creation
- **Example**:
  - Original: A 200-word paragraph about project management
  - Condensed: A focused 50-word summary hitting key points

#### 4. **Change Tone**
- **Purpose**: Adjusts writing style and tone
- **Available tones**:
  - **Formal**: Professional, structured language for business/academic contexts
  - **Casual**: Relaxed, conversational tone for informal communication  
  - **Academic**: Scholarly, precise language with technical vocabulary
  - **Friendly**: Warm, approachable tone that builds connection
- **Example**:
  - Casual: "Hey, this project is going pretty well!"
  - Formal: "The project is progressing satisfactorily according to schedule."

#### 5. **Custom Instructions ("Tell Nova...")**
- **Purpose**: Give specific instructions for transformation
- **Best for**: Unique requirements not covered by other options
- **Examples**:
  - "Rewrite this as bullet points"
  - "Make this sound more confident" 
  - "Convert to a numbered list"
  - "Add more technical detail"

### When to Use Selection vs Chat

**Use Selection when:**
- You have existing text that needs improvement
- You want quick, standard transformations
- Working on mobile (easier than typing commands)
- Making final polish edits

**Use Chat when:**
- Adding new content
- Combining multiple operations
- Need more control over the editing process

## Chat Commands & Cursor-Based Editing

Nova's chat system is designed around **cursor-based editing** with intelligent **intention detection**. Place your cursor where you want Nova to work and describe what you need‚ÄîNova automatically determines whether you want a conversational response or direct document editing.

### How Intention Detection Works

Nova analyzes your message to understand your intent:

**‚úÖ Editing Commands** (Nova edits your document):
- "add a conclusion here"
- "insert a methodology section"
- "create a methodology section"
- "add tags: productivity, writing"

**üí¨ Chat Responses** (Nova responds conversationally):
- "what should I write about?"
- "explain the difference between X and Y"
- "help me brainstorm ideas"
- "what's the best approach for this?"

### Cursor-Based Document Editing

When Nova detects an editing intent, it writes directly at your cursor position with real-time streaming updates.

#### Adding New Content
Place your cursor and describe what you want:
```
add a paragraph about the benefits of exercise
create an introduction for this chapter
write a conclusion summarizing the key points
insert a methodology section here
add literature review using [[Research Notes]]
create dialogue showing tension between these characters
add error handling examples from [[API Guidelines]]
write a detailed analysis of the current market trends
develop a comprehensive project timeline
create a character backstory with psychological depth
```

Nova can generate sophisticated content at your cursor position, from simple paragraphs to complex sections that incorporate context from referenced documents. The AI draws on its training to create detailed, contextually appropriate content based on your specific request.

#### Document Operations
Nova can modify document metadata and properties:
```
add tags: productivity, writing
set status to complete
update the title property
clean up tags
```

### Tag and Metadata Commands

Nova includes specialized commands for document properties:

**Tag Management:**
- `add tags: productivity, writing, AI` - Adds specific tags
- `add suggested tags` - Analyzes content and suggests relevant tags
- `clean up tags` - Removes duplicates and optimizes tag structure
- `remove tag: draft` - Removes specific tags

**Frontmatter Operations:**
- `set status to complete` - Updates frontmatter properties
- `add creation date` - Adds date fields
- `update the title property` - Modifies document properties

**What Tag Commands Edit:**
- ‚úÖ **Current document's frontmatter** - Tags and properties in the active file
- ‚úÖ **Document metadata** - YAML frontmatter fields
- ‚ùå **Other documents** - Commands only affect the current file
- ‚ùå **File names or folders** - Only document content and properties

**‚ùå Protected Fields (Nova Won't Edit These)**

1. **Creation Date Fields:**
   - created
   - date-created
   - created-date
   - creation-date
2. **Modification Date Fields:**
   - modified
   - last-modified
   - updated
   - date-modified
3. **Identifier Fields:**
   - id
   - uuid
   - uid
   - permalink
   - url
   - link

These fields are protected because they're typically:
- **System-generated** (like creation/modification dates)
- **Unique identifiers** that shouldn't be changed
- **Permanent references** (permalinks, URLs)

**Additional Restrictions**

Beyond these protected fields, Nova also has these limitations:

1. **Won't create new frontmatter** for general metadata operations (only exception is for tags)
2. **Won't add new properties** to documents without existing frontmatter
3. **Won't edit other documents** - only the current active file
4. **Won't modify file names or folder structures**

The protection is case-insensitive, so variations like Created, CREATED, or Date-Created are all protected.

### Natural Language Flexibility

Nova understands natural language variations. These all work for adding content:
- "add a conclusion"
- "write a summary at the end"
- "create a new section about results"
- "I need a paragraph explaining the process"

For selection-based custom instructions, use the "Tell Nova..." menu option for maximum flexibility with existing text.

### Undo Integration

Nova integrates seamlessly with Obsidian's native undo system:
- **First Ctrl/Cmd+Z**: Removes Nova's addition
- **Second Ctrl/Cmd+Z**: Restores original content (if text was replaced)
- Works exactly like any other Obsidian edit
- No special Nova-specific undo needed

### When Chat Responds vs. Edits

**Nova Edits Your Document When You:**
- Give specific instructions about content creation
- Place cursor and request new content to be added
- Use action words: add, create, write, edit, fix, improve, rewrite

**Nova Responds in Chat When You:**
- Ask questions or seek advice
- Request explanations or clarifications  
- Brainstorm or discuss ideas
- Use inquiry words: what, why, how, should, could, explain

---

## Document Context System

Nova can work with multiple documents simultaneously by referencing them in your conversations. This enables cross-document editing and analysis.

### Document Reference Syntax

#### Basic Reference: `[[document name]]`
```
Compare this section with [[Project Requirements]]
Use the methodology from [[Research Notes]] to improve this
```

### How Document Context Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: Nova automatically finds and includes referenced documents
2. **All References are Persistent**: Once you reference a document in a conversation, Nova remembers it for the entire chat session

### Managing Context

**Adding Documents to Context:**
- Type `[[document name]]` anywhere in your message
- Nova will automatically find and include the document
- The document stays in context for the entire conversation

**Context Panel:**
- Shows which documents are currently in context
- Displays estimated token usage
- Provides context usage warnings when approaching limits

**Context Limitations:**
- Each AI provider has different context limits
- Large documents consume more tokens
- Nova shows warnings when approaching limits
- Consider using smaller documents or excerpts for large files

### Practical Examples

**Cross-document reference:**
```
You: Add a methodology section using insights from [[Research Notes]]
Nova: [Creates new methodology section incorporating referenced content]
```

**Consistent metadata:**
```
You: Add the same tags as [[Project Plan]]
Nova: [Copies tags from referenced document to current document]
```

**Content creation with reference:**
```
You: Create a summary based on [[Meeting Template]] structure
Nova: [Generates new summary following the template format]
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Start with selection-based editing** for quick improvements to existing text
2. **Use chat commands for new content**  
3. **Reference documents strategically** - add context only when needed
4. **Monitor token usage** to avoid hitting limits
5. **Experiment with different providers** to find what works best for your tasks

### Writing Efficiently with Nova

1. **Draft first, polish later**: Write rough content, then use selection-based editing to improve
2. **Layer your edits**: Make multiple small improvements rather than trying to perfect everything at once
3. **Use templates**: Reference well-structured documents to maintain consistency
4. **Combine approaches**: Use chat for structure, selection for refinement

### Maximizing AI Effectiveness

1. **Be specific in commands**: "Make this more professional" works better than "improve this"
2. **Provide context when needed**: Reference relevant documents for consistency
3. **Use the right tool for the task**: Quick fixes with selection, complex work with chat
4. **Iterate and refine**: Don't expect perfection on the first try

Nova transforms how you work with text in Obsidian. By mastering both selection-based editing and chat commands, you'll develop a powerful, efficient writing workflow that feels natural and intuitive.
