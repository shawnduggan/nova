## June 15, 2025 - Selection-Based AI Editing Feature âœ…

### âœ… COMPLETED: Hybrid Notice-Based Thinking Animation System (FINAL)
**Perfect Implementation Achieved:**
- **Obsidian Notice Integration**: Clean UI feedback using native Notice API
- **Context-Aware Personality**: 10 unique thinking phrases per action type
  - Improve: "refining...", "polishing...", "enhancing...", "crafting...", etc.
  - Longer: "expanding...", "developing...", "elaborating...", "building...", etc.
  - Shorter: "condensing...", "distilling...", "tightening...", "focusing...", etc.
  - Tone: "adjusting tone...", "reshaping...", "reframing...", "adapting...", etc.
  - Custom: "working on it...", "considering...", "thinking...", "processing...", etc.
- **Progressive Dots Animation**: Starts with 1 dot, cycles through 5 (. â†’ .. â†’ ... â†’ .... â†’ .....)
- **Auto-Dismissing Notices**: Notice disappears when AI streaming begins
- **Perfect Streaming**: Text appears cleanly without selection highlighting
- **Optimal Undo Behavior**: Two-step undo (empty â†’ AI content â†’ original text)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Hybrid Approach**: Notice for feedback + document clearing for clean streaming
- **Selection Clearing**: Removes selected text immediately to create clean streaming position
- **Streaming Logic**: Fixed cascading replacement bugs with proper start/end position tracking
- **Notice Management**: Persistent notices with manual dismissal, dot animation management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive cleanup of positions and notices on errors

**User Experience Flow:**
1. Select text â†’ Right-click â†’ Choose Nova action
2. Notice appears: "Nova: refining." with animated dots cycling
3. Selected text clears from document (creates clean streaming position)
4. Notice dismisses when AI content begins streaming
5. AI content streams smoothly without text selection highlighting
6. Two clean undo steps: AI content â†’ empty â†’ original text

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/selection-context-menu.ts` - Complete notice system implementation
- Added notice creation, dots animation, streaming position management
- Fixed streaming logic with proper start/end position tracking
- Clean hybrid approach combining UI feedback with document streaming

**Status**: Perfect implementation ready for production. Provides excellent user feedback with clean streaming experience and intuitive undo behavior.

- 1-second minimum delay guarantees thinking animation visibility
- Streaming typewriter effect at 50ms intervals after delay
- Success/failure messages in Nova chat with proper styling
- Clean integration with existing selection-edit-command.ts

**User Experience Flow:**
1. Select text â†’ Right-click â†’ Choose Nova action
2. Selected text replaced with context-aware thinking phrase
3. Dots animate progressively for 1+ seconds showing Nova's intent
4. Seamless transition to streaming AI response
5. Success message appears in chat with operation summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/selection-context-menu.ts` - Added phrase arrays and dynamic selection
- `src/core/commands/selection-edit-command.ts` - Added 1-second minimum delay

### ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETED: UI Picker Architecture - Detailed Implementation

#### **New Picker System Implementation âœ…**

The new dual-trigger picker system is now fully integrated and working:

##### **Architecture Overview**
- **InputHandler**: Manages all input UI creation and event handling
- **CommandSystem**: Handles ":" trigger with structured editing commands
- **SectionPicker**: Handles "/" trigger with hierarchical document sections
- **ContextManager**: Manages multi-document context indicators

##### **Trigger System**
- **":" â†’ Command Picker**: Shows structured editing commands (append, prepend, edit, etc.)
- **"/" â†’ Section Picker**: Shows hierarchical document sections for targeting
- **"[[" â†’ Wikilink Picker**: Existing file autocomplete (unchanged)

##### **Implementation Details**
- **Consistent Styling**: All pickers use same dimensions (200px height, 4px margin)
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Old sidebar-view methods stubbed out for smooth transition
- **Clean Integration**: New architecture replaces old command picker completely
- **No Debug Logging**: Production-ready with clean console output

##### **File Changes Made**
- `src/ui/sidebar-view.ts` - Replaced old input system with new InputHandler integration
- `src/ui/input-handler.ts` - Enhanced with "/" trigger detection
- `src/ui/command-system.ts` - Removed legacy "/" command support, fixed picker sizing
- `src/ui/section-picker.ts` - Integrated with InputHandler, fixed DOM compatibility
- `src/ui/context-manager.ts` - Made contextIndicator/Preview public for compatibility

##### **Success Criteria Met**
- âœ… ":" shows properly sized command picker with editing commands only
- âœ… "/" shows section picker with hierarchical document sections
- âœ… Both match wikilink picker styling exactly
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Clean console output (no debug logging)

## June 15, 2025: Critical Bug Fixes & Ship Preparation

### ðŸ“‹ **COMPLETED: Cursor Position Preservation Bug** âœ…
- âœ… **Identified root causes** - Auto-focus stealing, no cursor storage, race conditions in focus management
- âœ… **Implemented file-scoped cursor tracking** - Eliminates cross-file contamination completely
- âœ… **Fixed file-editor consistency** - Robust getActiveEditor() ensures correct file targeting
- âœ… **Added event-based tracking** - editor-change events track cursor as it moves
- âœ… **Fixed command targeting** - Changed command parser defaults from 'end' to 'cursor'
- âœ… **Optimized context for add commands** - Only includes local context, not full document
- âœ… **Added comprehensive tests** - cursor-position.test.ts and cursor-preservation.test.ts
- âœ… **Removed all debug statements** - Clean production build ready

#### **Technical Details**
- Changed from global cursor map to file-scoped `currentFileCursorPosition`
- Modified getActiveEditor() to explicitly match editor to active file
