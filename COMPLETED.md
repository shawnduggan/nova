## Technical Implementation Details

### Message Storage Format
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

### Feature Release Configuration
```typescript
// feature-config.ts - Easy to modify post-launch
export const CATALYST_FEATURES = {
  'command-system': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-09-15',   // 3 months later
  },
  'multi-doc-context': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day  
    generalDate: '2025-08-15',   // 2 months later
  },
  'auto-input': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-07-15',   // 1 month later
  }
};
```

### New Settings Structure
```typescript
interface NovaSettings {
  // No more tier selection
  providers: Record<string, ProviderConfig>;
  customCommands: CustomCommand[];
  catalystLicense?: CatalystLicense;
  isCatalyst: boolean;
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Feature Checking Logic
```typescript
function isFeatureEnabled(featureId: string, user: User): boolean {
  const feature = CATALYST_FEATURES[featureId];
  const now = new Date();
  
  if (now >= new Date(feature.generalDate)) return true;
  if (user.isCatalyst && now >= new Date(feature.catalystDate)) return true;
  
  return false;
}
```

## 2025-01-12: Fixed Conversation Context Bug
**Task**: Clear conversation when all documents are closed
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All 502 tests passing

### Problem:
When the Nova sidebar was open but all documents were closed, Nova retained the conversation history of the last opened file instead of clearing itself.

### Root Cause:
The `loadConversationForActiveFile()` method had logic to fall back to any open markdown file when no active file was detected, but didn't handle the case where ALL files were closed. The condition `if (!targetFile || targetFile === this.currentFile)` would return early when there was no target file, leaving the previous conversation intact.

### Solution:
Added explicit handling for when no files are available but we still have a current file context:

```typescript
// If no file available and we have a current file, clear everything
if (!targetFile && this.currentFile) {
    this.currentFile = null;
    this.chatContainer.empty();
    this.refreshContext();
    this.addWelcomeMessage('Open a document to start chatting with Nova.');
    return;
}
```

### Files Modified:
- `src/ui/sidebar-view.ts` - Updated `loadConversationForActiveFile()` method

### Result:
- Nova now properly clears conversation history when all documents are closed
- Shows appropriate welcome message prompting user to open a document
- Maintains correct context state management
- No regressions in existing functionality

## 2025-01-12: Moved Command Button Setting to Supernova-Only Section
**Task**: Move "Show Command Button" setting to Custom Commands section and make it Supernova-only
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All 502 tests passing

### Problem:
The "Show Command Button" setting was in the General settings section, available to all users, but the actual command button functionality was gated behind Supernova access. This created inconsistent UX where non-Supernova users could enable a setting for a feature they couldn't access.

### Solution:
1. **Moved setting location**: From General section to Custom Commands section
2. **Applied feature gating**: Setting only visible to Supernova supporters
3. **Enhanced feature checking**: Command button visibility now checks both feature availability AND user preference
4. **Created centralized refresh system**: `refreshSupernovaUI()` method handles all Supernova UI updates

### Technical Changes:

**Settings Structure:**
- Moved `showCommandButton` from `general` to top-level in `NovaSettings`
- Placed setting UI in Custom Commands section (after feature availability check)
- Updated test mocks to reflect new structure

**Real-time UI Updates:**
- Created `refreshSupernovaUI()` method in sidebar-view.ts
- Added startup refresh after license validation in main.ts
- Updated all settings handlers to use centralized refresh

**Enhanced Feature Checking:**
```typescript
private shouldShowCommandButton(): boolean {
    // Check both feature availability AND user preference
    if (!this.plugin.featureManager.isFeatureEnabled('command-button')) {
        return false;
    }
    return this.plugin.settings.showCommandButton;
}
```

### Files Modified:
- `src/settings.ts` - Moved setting to Custom Commands section
- `src/ui/sidebar-view.ts` - Enhanced feature checking and centralized refresh
- `main.ts` - Added startup UI refresh
- `test/ai/provider-manager.test.ts` - Updated test structure

### Result:
- Setting only appears for Supernova supporters
- Command button properly disappears when Supernova access is lost (immediately for manual changes, on restart for expired licenses)
- Centralized refresh system ready for future Supernova features
- Consistent UX across all Supernova-gated functionality
