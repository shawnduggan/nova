## June 17, 2025 - UI Bug Fix ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: File Drawer Header Row Vertical Centering
**Problem**: File drawer header row had misaligned content when in closed state:
- Book icon was not properly vertically centered with text
- Header container lacked proper flex alignment for min-height constraints

**Solution**: Fixed vertical alignment through CSS improvements:
- Changed parent `contextIndicator` from `display: block` to `display: flex`
- Added `height: 100%` to `nova-context-summary` element
- Updated `filenamePartEl` to use flexbox with proper icon/text separation
- Created separate spans for icon and text with proper flex properties

**Files Changed**: `src/ui/sidebar-view.ts` (lines 982, 998, 1019-1027)
**Testing**: All 34 test suites passing, project builds successfully

## June 17, 2025 - Message System Improvements ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: Unified Message System Implementation
**Problem**: Three different message creation paths caused inconsistent UX:
- Success messages = Styled green pills ("✓ Content added")
- Command failures = Plain assistant bubbles ("Failed to add content") 
- System errors = Icon messages with mixed styling

**Solution**: Implemented unified error handling to match success message patterns:
- Added `addErrorIndicator()` method to sidebar matching `addSuccessIndicator()`
- Removed all `addAssistantMessage()` calls from command handlers for failures
- Updated sidebar command execution to use unified error display
- Both success and error messages now use consistent styled pills

**Result**: 
- Success = "✓ Content added" (styled green pill)
- Failure = "❌ Failed to add content" (styled red pill)  
- Both persist and restore consistently with conversation history
- All 34 test suites passing (368 tests)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Model Switch Message Persistence Fixed 
**Problem**: Model/provider switch messages used HTML icon messages that were too long, causing them to display as unstyled bubbles instead of styled pills, and weren't persisting to conversation history.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `createIconMessage()` calls with simple text in `switchToModel()` and `switchToProvider()` methods
- Updated colon command handlers (`:claude`, `:chatgpt`, etc.) to use plain text messages
- Fixed 6 additional system messages that weren't using unified message system
- Enforced emoji policy: only checkmark (✓) for success, X (❌) for errors

**Changes Made**:
- `switchToModel`: `createIconMessage` → `✓ Switched to ${provider} ${model}`
- `switchToProvider`: `createIconMessage` → `✓ Switched to ${provider}`  
- Colon commands: `createIconMessage` → `✓ Switched to ${provider}`
- Feature gates: `createIconMessage` → `❌ Commands are currently in early access...`
- Multi-doc context: `createIconMessage` → `✓ Included ${count} documents...`
- Custom templates: `createIconMessage` → `✓ Loaded template: ${name}`

**Result**: All model switch and system messages now appear as properly styled pills, persist to conversation history, and restore correctly when switching files.

## June 16, 2025 - UI Polish Tasks ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: Desktop Textarea Height Increase
**Implementation Details:**
- **Increased desktop textarea from 80px to 120px** (~5-6 lines of text)

- **Desktop styling**: `.is-desktop .nova-input-row textarea { min-height: 120px !important; }`

- **Clean separation**: Desktop and mobile have distinct, appropriate textarea sizes
- **Build verified**: Successfully compiles with no errors

## June 16, 2025 - Native File Picker Implementation ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: Modal System Standardization
**Problem Solved:**
- Custom file picker (triggered by `[[`) used HTML/CSS popup that mimicked but didn't match Obsidian design
- Users could tell it wasn't native Obsidian - violated design principle of being indistinguishable

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Replaced custom `NovaWikilinkAutocomplete` with native `FuzzySuggestModal`**
- **Same trigger** (`[[` in textarea) now opens native Obsidian file picker
- **Added instruction footer** with navigation hints (↑↓ to navigate, ↵ to use, esc to dismiss)
- **Preserved functionality** - selected files automatically added to conversation context

**Technical Achievements:**
- **Code reduction**: 425 lines → 153 lines (-68% in wikilink-suggest.ts)
- **Removed custom CSS**: Eliminated `.nova-wikilink-suggestions` styles
- **Clean architecture**: Native modal integration instead of custom popup
- **Perfect UX**: Users cannot distinguish from core Obsidian file picker

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/wikilink-suggest.ts` - Complete rewrite using `FuzzySuggestModal`
- `styles.css` - Removed custom file picker CSS
- `src/ui/context-manager.ts` - Cleaned up unused file picker code
- Deleted `src/ui/file-picker-modal.ts` and related test file

**Test Results:**
- All tests passing: 22/22 test suites, 321 tests total
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

- **Multi-word Tag Support**: Automatically converts spaces to hyphens (e.g., "nova scotia" → "nova-scotia")
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents adding duplicate tags automatically
- **Success Messages**: Clear feedback like "Added 7 suggested tags: ..." or "Cleaned up tags: 10 → 5 tags"

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Unified Provider Handling**: Removed all Google-specific code paths
- **Settings Integration**: All providers now use "Default Max Tokens" from plugin settings
- **ContextBuilder Enhancement**: Accepts settings in constructor to use user's configured limits
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All API errors are caught and displayed in chat, not console
- **Smart Tag Parsing**: Handles multiple response formats (JSON, comma-separated, line-based)
- **Provider Error Messages**: Clear, actionable errors (e.g., "Response truncated due to token limit. Please increase 'Default Max Tokens' in settings.")

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/context-builder.ts` - Now accepts settings and uses defaultMaxTokens
- `main.ts` - Passes settings to ContextBuilder
- `src/core/commands/metadata-command.ts` - Removed Google-specific handling, unified approach
- `src/ai/providers/google.ts` - Throws errors on truncation instead of returning partial content
- `src/ai/provider-manager.ts` - Added getDefaultMaxTokens() method

**Error Handling Flow:**
1. Provider encounters error → throws exception with clear message
2. Command handler catches → returns {success: false, error: "message"}
3. Sidebar view receives error → displays to user in chat as error message

**Status**: Production ready. All providers work consistently, respect user settings, and provide clear error feedback.

## June 16, 2025 - Sidebar Message Styling Unification ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: Unified Message System
**Created consistent visual hierarchy for all sidebar messages:**

**Problem Solved**: Inconsistent message styling with different widths and border radius
- Success messages appeared in narrow green pill boxes
- Longer success messages had excessive rounding and incorrect width
- Visual inconsistency between message types

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. User Messages** (No changes - already perfect)
- Blue chat bubbles with 80% max-width
- Standard rounded corners (--radius-m)

**2. System Responses** (Standardized)
- **Success messages**: Now match chat bubble width (80%) and border-radius
- **Error messages**: Same standardization as success messages
- **Color scheme**:
  - Success: Light green background (#f0f9f0) with dark green text (#2d5a2d)
  - Error: Light red background (#fef2f2) with dark red text (#7f1d1d)
- Left-aligned text for better readability

**3. Quick Status Pills** (Smart threshold)
- **20-character threshold** implemented in ChatRenderer
- Short messages (≤20 chars) use pill styling: "Content added", "Saved", etc.
- Longer messages use full message styling
- Pills: Centered, 20px border-radius, max-width 200px

**Technical Implementation**:
- Updated `.nova-message-success` and `.nova-message-error` CSS classes
- Added new `.nova-status-pill` class for short status messages
- Modified `addSuccessMessage()` to check message length
- Character count logic: `content.length <= 20 ? 'nova-status-pill' : 'nova-message-success'`

**Files Modified**:
- `styles.css` - Unified message styling with consistent dimensions
- `src/ui/chat-renderer.ts` - Added 20-character threshold logic

**Result**: Clean, consistent visual hierarchy throughout the sidebar with smart message type detection
