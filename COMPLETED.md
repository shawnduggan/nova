## Technical Context

### Key Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

### Feature Release Configuration
```typescript
// feature-config.ts - Easy to modify post-launch
export const CATALYST_FEATURES = {
  'command-system': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-09-15',   // 3 months later
  },
  'multi-doc-context': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day  
    generalDate: '2025-08-15',   // 2 months later
  },
  'auto-input': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-07-15',   // 1 month later
  }
};
```

### New Settings Structure
```typescript
interface NovaSettings {
  // No more tier selection
  providers: Record<string, ProviderConfig>;
  customCommands: CustomCommand[];
  catalystLicense?: CatalystLicense;
  isCatalyst: boolean;
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Feature Checking Logic
```typescript
function isFeatureEnabled(featureId: string, user: User): boolean {
  const feature = CATALYST_FEATURES[featureId];
  const now = new Date();
  
  if (now >= new Date(feature.generalDate)) return true;
  if (user.isCatalyst && now >= new Date(feature.catalystDate)) return true;
  
  return false;
}
```
