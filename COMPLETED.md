## June 16, 2025 - Enhanced Tag Operations ✅

### ✅ COMPLETED: AI-Powered Tag Management System
**Comprehensive tag functionality with unified provider handling:**

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Natural Language Tag Commands**: "Add tags: research, important" operates on document metadata
- **AI-Powered Tag Suggestions**: "Add suggested tags" analyzes document content and suggests relevant tags
- **Tag Operations**: Support for add, remove, set, clean up, optimize tags
- **Multi-word Tag Support**: Automatically converts spaces to hyphens (e.g., "nova scotia" → "nova-scotia")
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents adding duplicate tags automatically
- **Success Messages**: Clear feedback like "Added 7 suggested tags: ..." or "Cleaned up tags: 10 → 5 tags"

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Unified Provider Handling**: Removed all Google-specific code paths
- **Settings Integration**: All providers now use "Default Max Tokens" from plugin settings
- **ContextBuilder Enhancement**: Accepts settings in constructor to use user's configured limits
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: All API errors are caught and displayed in chat, not console
- **Smart Tag Parsing**: Handles multiple response formats (JSON, comma-separated, line-based)
- **Provider Error Messages**: Clear, actionable errors (e.g., "Response truncated due to token limit. Please increase 'Default Max Tokens' in settings.")

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/context-builder.ts` - Now accepts settings and uses defaultMaxTokens
- `main.ts` - Passes settings to ContextBuilder
- `src/core/commands/metadata-command.ts` - Removed Google-specific handling, unified approach
- `src/ai/providers/google.ts` - Throws errors on truncation instead of returning partial content
- `src/ai/provider-manager.ts` - Added getDefaultMaxTokens() method

**Error Handling Flow:**
1. Provider encounters error → throws exception with clear message
2. Command handler catches → returns {success: false, error: "message"}
3. Sidebar view receives error → displays to user in chat as error message

**Status**: Production ready. All providers work consistently, respect user settings, and provide clear error feedback.
