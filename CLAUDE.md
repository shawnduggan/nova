# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## CRITICAL: Read These Rules First

### Atomic Changes Only
**One small testable change per response. Period.**
- If it takes >2 minutes to implement, it's too big
- Each change must be immediately testable
- No bundling multiple features

### Action Over Discussion
- CODE FIRST, explain later (if needed)
- No "I'll help you..." preambles
- No long explanations before coding
- Start typing code within first 3 lines

### Complete Code Only
- No TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders
- Every function must work when implemented
- Make reasonable decisions instead of asking

### Progress Tracking
- **ALWAYS use this CLAUDE.md file for tracking progress**
- Do NOT use TodoWrite/TodoRead or any session-based tracking
- Update checkboxes in this file when completing tasks
- Add new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section

### Design Guidelines
- **ALWAYS use Obsidian's native design language and iconography**
- NO emojis - use clean SVG outline icons that match Obsidian's style
- Use ButtonComponent.setIcon() for all buttons and UI elements
- Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography with Obsidian
- Icons should use currentColor for theme compatibility
- Follow Obsidian's responsive design patterns for mobile/desktop

## 📋 PLANNED: Multi-Document Context UX Improvements

### **Current Issues Identified**
1. **Document Removal UX**: Only global "Clear All" button, no individual document removal
2. **Temporary vs Persistent Complexity**: Two syntaxes (`[[doc]]` vs `+[[doc]]`) create cognitive overhead
3. **Context Display Issues**: Plain text list, no visual distinction, limited interactivity

### **Recommended Path: Simplified Persistent-Only Model**
**Strategy**: Remove temporary vs persistent distinction for simpler UX
- **Single syntax**: `[[document]]` always adds to conversation context
- **Context persists** until manually removed or conversation cleared
- **Benefits**: Simpler mental model, fewer decisions, cleaner UX

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Context Management Panel**
```
📚 Context (3 documents, 45% tokens)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [📄] Project Notes              [×] │
│ [📄] Meeting Transcript         [×] │  
│ [📄] Requirements Document      [×] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features to Implement**:
- **Interactive document cards** with hover states and individual remove buttons
- **Expandable/collapsible** context panel below input area
- **Token usage visualization** with progress bar
- **Smart truncation** of long document names
- **Drag to reorder** documents in context (future enhancement)

### **Phase 2: Simplified Syntax Implementation**
- **Remove `+[[]]` syntax** entirely (keep temporarily for migration)
- **All `[[document]]` references** add to persistent context
- **Auto-cleanup** when conversation is cleared
- **Migration path**: Deprecate `+[[]]` while maintaining backward compatibility

### **Phase 3: Advanced UX Enhancements**
- **Smart context suggestions** based on current conversation
- **Document content preview** on hover
- **Context templates** for common document sets
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl+D to add, Ctrl+Shift+C to clear all)

### **Technical Implementation Plan**
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/ui/sidebar-view.ts` - Context panel redesign, individual remove handlers
- `src/core/multi-doc-context.ts` - Simplified model (remove temp/persistent distinction)
- `styles.css` - Document card styling, context panel improvements
- Tests - Update for simplified model and new UI interactions

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Keep both syntaxes working but show all docs as persistent context
2. Update UI to interactive document cards with individual removal
3. Eventually deprecate `+[[]]` syntax entirely
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### **After Context UX: Time Gate Configuration**
**Phase 0 Day 8-9: Time Gate Configuration** (Moved to after context improvements)
- Create flexible date-based feature configuration
- Implement isFeatureEnabled() with date checking
- Add "Early Access" indicators for Catalyst features
- Test time gate functionality
- Ensure easy date modification for feature releases

  'command-system': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-09-15',   // 3 months later
  },
  'multi-doc-context': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day  
    generalDate: '2025-08-15',   // 2 months later
  },
  'auto-input': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-07-15',   // 1 month later
  }
};
```

### New Settings Structure
```typescript
interface NovaSettings {
  // No more tier selection
  providers: Record<string, ProviderConfig>;
  customCommands: CustomCommand[];
  catalystLicense?: CatalystLicense;
  isCatalyst: boolean;
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Feature Checking Logic
```typescript
function isFeatureEnabled(featureId: string, user: User): boolean {
  const feature = CATALYST_FEATURES[featureId];
  const now = new Date();
  
  if (now >= new Date(feature.generalDate)) return true;
  if (user.isCatalyst && now >= new Date(feature.catalystDate)) return true;
  
  return false;
}

**ALWAYS strive for simple, clean, and maintainable code:**
- **Simplicity**: Remove unnecessary complexity, prefer straightforward solutions
- **Cleanliness**: No dead code, clear naming, consistent formatting
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **When refactoring**: Always simplify and clean up, don't just add features
- **Code reviews**: Ask "Is this the simplest way to solve this problem?"

### Making Changes (Catalyst Implementation)
1. Remove tier restrictions systematically
2. Implement time-based feature gates
3. Build all features, gate for Catalyst early access
4. Update tests as you go
5. **Mark completed tasks with [x] in this CLAUDE.md file**
6. **Add any new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section**
7. **Always prioritize code simplicity and maintainability**

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why
- **NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Always wait for user confirmation before committing and pushing

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

## Technical Context

### Key Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```
