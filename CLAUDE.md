# Nova Plugin Development – CLAUDE.md

## 🧠 Core Engineering Principles

- ✅ **Extend, Don't Duplicate** – Reuse existing patterns and functions. Never add redundant logic.
- ✅ **DRY + SOLID** – Apply clear separation of concerns. No copy-paste logic, magic strings, or tightly coupled flows.
- ✅ **Stable Contracts** – Changes must not break existing provider, UI, or state interfaces.
- ✅ **Performance-Aware** – Avoid unnecessary DOM updates or state recalculations. Profile when needed.

## 🧱 Architecture Constraints

- ✅ Use **event-driven communication**:
  - One component must never directly call methods on another.
  - All shared updates must go through a `StateManager` or emit/subscribed events.
  - No chained `.refresh()` calls across views or managers.
- ✅ UI components **listen** to state, not control other parts of the system.
- ✅ Avoid side effects in constructor/init logic. Use explicit `init()` methods where needed.
- ✅ Use `constants.ts` or `config.ts` for all strings, selectors, and static values.

## 🧪 Development & Testing

- ✅ Always write or update tests before implementing new business logic.
- ❌ Avoid UI snapshot or DOM unit tests unless explicitly requested.
- ✅ Test all edge cases that affect global state or plugin behavior.

## 🛑 Strict Behavior Rules

- ❌ **Do NOT begin coding until explicitly instructed to.**
- ❌ **Do NOT make commits unless I tell you to.**
- ❌ **Do NOT start new tasks without confirmation.**
- ❌ **Do NOT assign styles via JavaScript or in HTML. Sse CSS.**
- ❌ **Do NOT use innerHTML, outerHTML or similar API's. Use the DOM API or the Obsidian helper functions.**
- ❌ **Do NOT mention Claude, Generated with assistance, or Co-authored phrasing in commit messages.**

> Your default mode is read-only and analytical. Only switch to write mode when prompted.

## 🧰 Serena MCP Usage

- ✅ Always call `initial_instructions` before starting any programming task.
- ✅ Run `check_onboarding_performed` and complete onboarding if needed.
- ✅ Use symbolic tools (`find_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`, etc.) – avoid direct file edits when possible.
- ✅ Use `get_symbols_overview` to understand structure before making changes.
- ✅ Use `think_about_collected_information` before writing code.
- ✅ Use `think_about_task_adherence` before editing any file.
- ✅ Always run `summarize_changes` after non-trivial tasks.

> Never execute or modify without reasoning through the task first.

## 📋 Current Tasks


### Future Enhancements 

**MEDIUM User-configurable log levels**: Add setting in plugin settings tab to allow users to adjust logging verbosity (Debug, Info, Warn, Error). Currently hardcoded to INFO level. Would help with troubleshooting and support, and allow users to reduce logging overhead if needed.

**LOW Add slider setting for scroll speed**: Maybe on the General settings tab.
