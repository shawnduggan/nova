# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## CRITICAL: Read These Rules First

### Atomic Changes Only
**One small testable change per response. Period.**
- If it takes >2 minutes to implement, it's too big
- Each change must be immediately testable
- No bundling multiple features

### Action Over Discussion
- CODE FIRST, explain later (if needed)
- No "I'll help you..." preambles
- No long explanations before coding
- Start typing code within first 3 lines

### Complete Code Only
- No TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders
- Every function must work when implemented
- Make reasonable decisions instead of asking

## Development Workflow (Current Phase: Technical Features)

### Current Focus: Phase 0 Implementation
1. **Feature Development**: Custom commands, multi-doc context, UI improvements
2. **Core vs Supernova**: Properly gate premium features
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% coverage with new features
4. **Atomic Changes**: One small testable change per response
5. **Integration**: Ensure new features work with existing code

---

## Session Instructions

### Starting a Session (Technical Features Phase)
1. Load this file first
2. Check current production status (all tests passing)
3. Focus on Phase 0 tasks: custom commands, multi-doc context, UI
4. One atomic change at a time only

### Making Changes (Feature Development)
1. Test before and after every change
2. Properly gate Supernova features
3. Maintain 100% test coverage
4. Follow existing code patterns

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

---

## Example Prompts for Next Session (Technical Features)

### Good First Prompt:
"Start Phase 0: Create the custom command system types and interfaces"

### Good Follow-up:
"Implement the colon trigger for desktop command picker"

### Feature Implementation:
"Add multi-document context parsing for [[doc]] syntax"

### If Issues Found:
"Fix failing tests while maintaining feature functionality"

---

## Technical Context

### Key Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

## Remember
- MVP only - no extra features
- Working > Perfect
- Ship in 3-4 days
- One atomic change at a time
