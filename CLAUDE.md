# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## CRITICAL: Read These Rules First

### Atomic Changes Only
**One small testable change per response. Period.**
- If it takes >2 minutes to implement, it's too big
- Each change must be immediately testable
- No bundling multiple features

### Action Over Discussion
- CODE FIRST, explain later (if needed)
- No "I'll help you..." preambles
- No long explanations before coding
- Start typing code within first 3 lines

### Complete Code Only
- No TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders
- Every function must work when implemented
- Make reasonable decisions instead of asking

### Progress Tracking
- **ALWAYS use this CLAUDE.md file for tracking progress**
- Do NOT use TodoWrite/TodoRead or any session-based tracking
- Update checkboxes in this file when completing tasks
- Add new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section

## Implementation Details for Catalyst Model

### Feature Release Configuration
```typescript
// feature-config.ts - Easy to modify post-launch
export const CATALYST_FEATURES = {
  'command-system': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-09-15',   // 3 months later
  },
  'multi-doc-context': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day  
    generalDate: '2025-08-15',   // 2 months later
  },
  'auto-input': {
    catalystDate: '2025-06-15',  // Launch day
    generalDate: '2025-07-15',   // 1 month later
  }
};
```

### New Settings Structure
```typescript
interface NovaSettings {
  // No more tier selection
  providers: Record<string, ProviderConfig>;
  customCommands: CustomCommand[];
  catalystLicense?: CatalystLicense;
  isCatalyst: boolean;
  // ... other settings
}
```

### Feature Checking Logic
```typescript
function isFeatureEnabled(featureId: string, user: User): boolean {
  const feature = CATALYST_FEATURES[featureId];
  const now = new Date();
  
  if (now >= new Date(feature.generalDate)) return true;
  if (user.isCatalyst && now >= new Date(feature.catalystDate)) return true;
  
  return false;
}
```

## Development Workflow (Current Phase: Monetization Pivot)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Progress Tracking
**All progress tracking must be done in this CLAUDE.md file by updating checkboxes.**
**Do NOT use TodoWrite/TodoRead or any other session-based tracking tools.**

### Current Focus: Catalyst Model Implementation
1. **Remove Feature Gates**: All features free with user API keys
2. **Build Catalyst System**: Time-based early access for supporters
3. **Implement New Features**: Command system, multi-doc context, UI
4. **Test Coverage**: Update 476 tests for new model
5. **Atomic Changes**: One small testable change per response

---

## Session Instructions

### Starting a Session (Monetization Pivot Phase)
1. Load this file first
2. Review Catalyst model requirements
3. Focus on Phase 0 tasks in order
4. One atomic change at a time only
5. **Track all progress by updating checkboxes in this file**

### Making Changes (Catalyst Implementation)
1. Remove tier restrictions systematically
2. Implement time-based feature gates
3. Build all features, gate for Catalyst early access
4. Update tests as you go
5. **Mark completed tasks with [x] in this CLAUDE.md file**
6. **Add any new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section**

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

---

## Example Prompts for Next Session (Monetization Pivot)

### Good First Prompt:
"Start Phase 0 Day 1: Transform feature-manager.ts to time-based gating"

### Removing Tier Gates:
"Remove Core/Supernova tier restrictions from sidebar-view.ts"

### Building New Features:
"Implement : command trigger system for provider switching"

### Time Gate Implementation:
"Create feature-config.ts with Catalyst early access dates"

### If Issues Found:
"Fix failing tests after removing tier logic"

---

## Technical Context

### Key Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```
