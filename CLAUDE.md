# Nova Plugin Development – CLAUDE.md

## 🧠 Core Engineering Principles

- ✅ **Extend, Don't Duplicate** – Reuse existing patterns and functions. Never add redundant logic.
- ✅ **DRY + SOLID** – Apply clear separation of concerns. No copy-paste logic, magic strings, or tightly coupled flows.
- ✅ **Stable Contracts** – Changes must not break existing provider, UI, or state interfaces.
- ✅ **Performance-Aware** – Avoid unnecessary DOM updates or state recalculations. Profile when needed.

## 📚 Required Context & Strategic Documentation

**Before coding, read Nova's core strategic docs** in /Users/shawn/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Basecamp/09-Projects/Nova/Core Docs/ to understand Nova.

**Strategic Focus:** Nova solves "where did AI put that?" by letting users control exactly where edits happen - select text to transform it, place cursor to create content exactly there.

**Notify me when significant changes might affect the Core Docs:** New features, architecture changes, competitive positioning shifts, or major technical debt resolution.

## 🧱 Architecture Constraints

- ✅ Use **event-driven communication**:
  - One component must never directly call methods on another.
  - All shared updates must go through a `StateManager` or emit/subscribed events.
  - No chained `.refresh()` calls across views or managers.
- ✅ UI components **listen** to state, not control other parts of the system.
- ✅ Avoid side effects in constructor/init logic. Use explicit `init()` methods where needed.
- ✅ Use `constants.ts` or `config.ts` for all strings, selectors, and static values.

## 🧪 Development & Testing

- ✅ Always write or update tests before implementing new business logic.
- ❌ Avoid UI snapshot or DOM unit tests unless explicitly requested.
- ✅ Test all edge cases that affect global state or plugin behavior.

## 🛑 Strict Behavior Rules

- ❌ **Do NOT begin coding until explicitly instructed to.**
- ❌ **Do NOT make commits unless I tell you to.**
- ❌ **Do NOT start new tasks without confirmation.**
- ❌ **Do NOT assign styles via JavaScript or in HTML. Use CSS.**
- ❌ **Do NOT use innerHTML, outerHTML or similar API's. Use the DOM API or the Obsidian helper functions.**
- ❌ **Do NOT mention Claude, Generated with assistance, or Co-authored phrasing in commit messages.**
- ❌ **Do NOT use console statements in production code. Use the Logger utility.**
- ❌ **Avoid type assertions like `as Type`. Prefer proper typing with interfaces or explicit declarations.**

> Your default mode is read-only and analytical. Only switch to write mode when prompted.

## 🔒 Obsidian Plugin Compliance Requirements

**These requirements are CRITICAL for Community Plugin store approval:**

### Plugin Manifest Requirements
- ❌ **No outdated minAppVersion**: Must be "1.7.2" or later when using modern APIs
- ✅ **Payment disclosure in README**: Clearly document if payment is required for full access
- ✅ **Static ads only if documented**: Banner/popup ads only allowed if clearly indicated in README

### Event Listener Registration
- ❌ **Never use direct `addEventListener()`**: Creates memory leaks on plugin reload
- ✅ **Use Obsidian's registration system**: All `addEventListener()` calls must use `this.registerDomEvent()` or `this.plugin.registerDomEvent()`
- ✅ **Component-based classes**: Use `this.registerDomEvent(element, event, handler)`
- ✅ **Plugin-referenced classes**: Use `this.plugin.registerDomEvent(element, event, handler)`
- ✅ **Manual cleanup for standalone classes**: Implement cleanup methods connected to plugin's onunload

### Timer Registration
- ❌ **Never use unregistered setInterval/setTimeout**: Creates memory leaks on plugin reload  
- ✅ **Use registerInterval for all timers**: All `setInterval()` calls must use `this.registerInterval()`
- ✅ **Component-based classes**: Use `this.registerInterval(window.setInterval(callback, delay))`
- ✅ **Plugin-referenced classes**: Use `this.plugin.registerInterval(window.setInterval(callback, delay))`
- ✅ **Pass plugin reference to managers**: Classes needing timers must receive plugin reference for registration
- ❌ **No manual clearInterval needed**: Obsidian handles cleanup automatically when registered
- ❌ **No bare setInterval calls**: Even in standalone classes, must connect to plugin registration system

### CSS and Styling Requirements  
- ❌ **No core styling overrides**: Never override `.view-content` globally - scope to your plugin containers
- ❌ **No dynamic style tags**: Never create `<style>` elements that aren't cleaned up on unload
- ❌ **No inline styles in JS**: Never use `element.style.property = value` or HTML style attributes
- ❌ **No setCssProps for static styles**: Use CSS classes instead of `setCssProps` for static styling  
- ✅ **CSS custom properties OK**: Dynamic theming with `setCssProps({'--custom-prop': value})` is acceptable
- ✅ **Move all styles to CSS**: All static styles must be in styles.css for theme compatibility

### Settings Section Requirements
- ❌ **No top-level plugin name heading**: Don't add "PluginName Settings" or "Welcome to PluginName" - context is already clear
- ❌ **No createEl('h2'/'h3'/'h4') for settings sections**: Raw heading elements not allowed for main settings sections
- ✅ **Use Setting API for sections**: `new Setting(container).setName('Section Name').setHeading()`
- ✅ **Info cards can use DOM headings**: Headings within informational UI elements (.nova-info-card) are OK
- ❌ **No "Settings" or "Configuration" in headings**: Redundant since already in settings context
- ❌ **No "Welcome to [Plugin]" headings**: Plugin context is already clear in settings tabs
- ✅ **Use sentence case**: "Getting started" not "Getting Started"
- ❌ **No promotional content in multiple tabs**: Limit ads/CTAs to one dedicated tab at bottom of tab list

### Command Registration
- ❌ **No plugin name in command IDs**: Don't prefix commands with plugin name - Obsidian handles conflicts
- ✅ **Descriptive command IDs**: Use clear, action-based IDs like "improve-writing", not "nova-improve-writing"
- ❌ **No "open-[plugin]-sidebar" pattern**: Use "open-sidebar" instead of "open-nova-sidebar"
- ✅ **Action-focused naming**: Commands should describe what they do, not what plugin they belong to
- ❌ **Remove ALL plugin name prefixes**: This includes "nova-", "[PluginName]-", or any brand-specific prefixes
- ✅ **Generic action verbs**: Use verbs like "open", "toggle", "create", "improve" without plugin context

### Modern Obsidian APIs
- ❌ **No deprecated activeLeaf**: Use `workspace.getActiveViewOfType(MarkdownView)` instead
- ❌ **No fetch()**: Use `requestUrl()` for CORS handling and proper Obsidian integration  
- ❌ **No vault.modify()**: Use Editor API (`editor.replaceRange()`, `editor.setValue()`) to preserve cursor/selection/undo
- ❌ **No custom SVG creation**: Use `addIcon()` and `setIcon()` instead of `document.createElementNS()`
- ❌ **No private APIs**: Use public APIs like `Notice.messageEl` instead of private `noticeEl`
- ❌ **No NodeJS types**: Use `number` with `window.setTimeout()` instead of `NodeJS.Timeout`
- ✅ **Handle deferred views**: Properly handle deferred views introduced in v1.7.2+ with `isDeferred` checks

### Performance & File Operations
- ❌ **No inefficient file iteration**: Don't use `getMarkdownFiles()` to find specific files by path
- ❌ **No getAbstractFileByPath**: Use `vault.getFileByPath()` directly for better performance
- ❌ **No redundant operations**: Don't call `saveData()` multiple times unnecessarily
- ❌ **No regex parsing for headings**: Use `metadataCache.getFileCache(file).headings` instead of regex
- ✅ **Use efficient APIs**: Use `vault.getFileByPath()` and `metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest()`

### Security & Data Protection
- ❌ **No plaintext sensitive keys**: Obfuscate license signing keys or other sensitive strings
- ❌ **No analytics collection**: Plugins cannot collect user analytics per Developer Policies
- ✅ **Method naming clarity**: Use clear names like "recordForState" not "trackForAnalytics"
- ❌ **No analytics-adjacent method names**: Avoid "track", "analytics", "telemetry", "collect" in method names
- ✅ **State-focused naming**: Use "record", "store", "save", "cache" for internal state management
- ❌ **Remove ambiguous methods entirely**: If method could be misinterpreted as analytics, remove it

### UI/UX Guidelines
- ✅ **Use native components**: Use `DropdownComponent` instead of custom dropdown implementations
- ❌ **No ads at top of settings**: Limit promotional content to one dedicated tab at bottom  
- ❌ **No Notice for non-urgent info**: Use proper UI elements, not Notice API for license messages
- ✅ **Proper mobile support**: Handle mobile views appropriately without unnecessary restrictions
- ❌ **No promotional content in multiple tabs**: CTAs/ads must be confined to ONE dedicated tab only
- ✅ **Bottom placement for ads**: If promotional content exists, place at bottom of tab list
- ❌ **No intrusive messaging**: Avoid popup/banner ads that interrupt user workflow

### CSS Cleanup Requirements
- ❌ **No orphaned CSS classes**: Remove unused CSS after refactoring components
- ❌ **No custom dropdown CSS with DropdownComponent**: Remove all custom dropdown styling when using native components
- ✅ **Clean up after component migrations**: Always remove related CSS when replacing custom components
- ✅ **CSS maintenance**: Regularly audit and remove unused styles for performance

### Task Completion Verification
**A compliance task is ONLY complete when ZERO instances remain in the codebase.**

Before marking any compliance task as complete:
1. ✅ Run comprehensive pattern searches (use `Grep` tool with appropriate patterns)
2. ✅ Verify build succeeds with 0 errors (`npm run build`)
3. ✅ Check ESLint shows 0 errors (`npx eslint src/ --format=unix | grep error`)
4. ✅ Confirm all tests pass (`npm test`)
5. ✅ Document specific changes made and patterns replaced

Never mark compliance tasks complete without systematic verification.

## ✅ Quality Assurance Requirements

**After ANY code changes, you MUST:**
- ✅ Run `npm run build` - must complete with 0 errors
- ✅ Run `npm test` - all tests must pass (476+ tests)
- ✅ Check ESLint status - 0 errors allowed (warnings are acceptable)
- ✅ Verify TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Confirm all imports resolve correctly

**Before considering any task complete:**
- ✅ Validate that production code builds successfully
- ✅ Ensure no ESLint errors remain (use `npx eslint src/ --format=unix | grep error`)
- ✅ Verify all tests continue to pass

> If build, tests, or linting fail, the task is NOT complete until all issues are resolved.

## 🛠️ Tool Usage Guidelines

- ✅ Use `Task` tool for complex searches across multiple files
- ✅ Use `Grep` and `Glob` for specific pattern searches
- ✅ Use `Read` tool for examining specific files
- ✅ Use `Edit` or `MultiEdit` for code changes
- ✅ Use `TodoWrite` only as optional session-internal working memory
- ✅ Always reason through the task before making changes

> CLAUDE.md is the authoritative task source. TodoWrite is temporary session state only.

## 🔄 Session Continuity Guidelines

**When context runs low or session ends:**
- ✅ Update task status in Current Tasks section with progress notes
- ✅ Document any work-in-progress with specific next steps
- ✅ Add any discovered issues to Known Issues section
- ✅ Note which Quality Assurance steps still need completion
- ✅ Include relevant file paths and line numbers for context

**Task Status Format:**
- **IN PROGRESS**: [Brief description] - Next: [specific next step]
- **BLOCKED**: [Brief description] - Blocked by: [specific issue]
- **PENDING**: [Brief description] - Waiting for: [dependency/approval]

### Future Enhancements

**LOW Remove privacy indicator on mobile view**: It doesn't provide value on mobile - all models are cloud

**MEDIUM Mobile Model Dropdown has no padding**: The provider names do, but the model names don't. We've tried to fix this a few times with no luck.

**LOW Consolidate input trigger detection**: Currently wikilinks (`[[`) and commands (`:`) use separate input listeners. Should consolidate into unified trigger detection system in InputHandler for better performance and cleaner architecture.

### Someday Maybe

**LOW Add slider setting for scroll speed**: Maybe on the General settings tab.

**MEDIUM User-configurable log levels**: Add setting in plugin settings tab to allow users to adjust logging verbosity (Debug, Info, Warn, Error). Currently hardcoded to INFO level. Would help with troubleshooting and support, and allow users to reduce logging overhead if needed.
