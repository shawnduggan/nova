# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## CRITICAL: Read These Rules First

### Atomic Changes Only
**One small testable change per response. Period.**
- If it takes >2 minutes to implement, it's too big
- Each change must be immediately testable
- No bundling multiple features

### Action Over Discussion
- CODE FIRST, explain later (if needed)
- No "I'll help you..." preambles
- No long explanations before coding
- Start typing code within first 3 lines

### Complete Code Only
- No TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders
- Every function must work when implemented
- Make reasonable decisions instead of asking

## Development Workflow (Current Phase: Ship Preparation)

### Current Focus: Performance & Polish
1. **Performance First**: Optimize before adding features
2. **Real Device Testing**: Validate mobile experience
3. **User Feedback**: Incorporate beta testing
4. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain 100% test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Keep all docs current

---

## Session Instructions

### Starting a Session (Ship Preparation Phase)
1. Load this file first
2. Check current production status (all tests passing)
3. Focus on Phase 1 tasks: performance, testing, polish
4. One task at a time only

### Making Changes (Production Focus)
1. Test before and after every change
2. Validate on real devices when possible
3. Maintain 100% test coverage
4. Document performance impacts

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

---

## Example Prompts for Next Session (Ship Preparation)

### Good First Prompt:
"Start Phase 1: Run bundle size analysis and check performance"

### Good Follow-up:
"Test mobile upgrade interface on actual mobile device"

### Performance Focus:
"Optimize loading times and memory usage for large documents"

### If Issues Found:
"Fix performance issue X while maintaining test coverage"

---

## Technical Context

### Key Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

## Remember
- MVP only - no extra features
- Working > Perfect
- Ship in 3-4 days
- One atomic change at a time
