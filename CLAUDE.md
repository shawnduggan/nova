# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## BEHAVIORAL COMMANDS - READ FIRST

### MANDATORY RULES
**NEVER start responses with explanations or "I'll help you" - CODE IMMEDIATELY**
**ONE CHANGE PER RESPONSE** - If it involves multiple concerns, refuse and break it down
**WAIT FOR TEST CONFIRMATION** - After any fix, ask user to test before proceeding to next task
**NO AUTO-COMMITS** - Never commit unless explicitly commanded
**NO TODOS/STUBS** - Every function must work when implemented

### TDD PROTOCOL - MANDATORY
**SEQUENCE:**
1. Write failing test FIRST
2. Write minimal code to pass test
3. Use subagent to run test: `npm test -- filename.test.js`
4. State: "Test result: PASS/FAIL"
5. If FAIL: use subagent to investigate (lint, compile)
6. State: "Test this change. Type PASS or FAIL:"
7. STOP - wait for user response
8. If user says FAIL: debug, don't proceed
9. If user says PASS: ask "Next change?"

### SUBAGENT USAGE
**USE subagents for repetitive verification tasks:**
- Test execution: `npm test -- filename.test.js`
- TypeScript compilation: `tsc --noEmit`
- Linting: `eslint src/filename.ts`
- Build verification: `npm run build`
- File operations: reading/writing test files

**ALWAYS ask before using subagents for:**
- Git operations (already forbidden to auto-commit)
- Installing packages
- Modifying config files
- Any system-level changes

**SUBAGENT WORKFLOW:**
1. Write test + implementation
2. Use subagent to run test immediately
3. Report results: "Test passed/failed"
4. If failed: use subagent to investigate (lint, compile check)
5. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

### ATOMIC CHANGE DEFINITION
- ONE logical concern per response
- ONE function/component/test per response
- MUST fit in single git commit message
- User can understand the change in 30 seconds

**SIZE GUIDELINES:**
- Simple bug fix: 5-20 lines
- New function: 20-50 lines  
- New component: 30-80 lines
- Integration change: 40-100 lines
- **ABSOLUTE MAX: 100 lines per response**

### REJECTION CRITERIA
**TOO BIG if it involves:**
- Multiple unrelated files
- Multiple logical concerns
- Changes that affect multiple features
- "And also..." in the description

**COUNTER-OFFER:** "That's too big. Pick ONE specific change."

### ANTI-REFACTOR RULES
**ONLY modify code needed to pass the test**
**NEVER "improve" untested code**
**NEVER touch working code without explicit test**
**If you see "opportunities" - IGNORE THEM**

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**
- "While we're here..."
- "This would be cleaner if..."
- "Let me also fix..."
- "I noticed we could improve..."

**IF YOU MODIFY MORE THAN THE TEST REQUIRES:**
Immediately revert and respond: "I overstepped. Focusing only on: [test requirement]"

### SCOPE LOCKDOWN
**SCOPE TEST:** Can you describe this change in one sentence without "and"?
- GOOD: "Add validation to email input field"
- BAD: "Add validation to email and fix the styling and update the tests"

**REVERT TRIGGER:** If you find yourself changing something unrelated to the test, STOP immediately.

### REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE
```
[3 lines max describing the ONE change]

**Test:**
[Test code block]

**Implementation:**
[Implementation code block]

**Verification:**
[Subagent runs test automatically]
Test result: PASS/FAIL

Test this change. Type PASS or FAIL:
```
[STOP - no additional text]

### VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE STOP
If you catch yourself writing >100 lines, STOP MID-SENTENCE and say:
"This change is too big. Breaking into smaller pieces..."

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - Even if the user says "just do it all"
**NO NEGOTIATIONS** - Don't explain why, just enforce

### Design Guidelines
- **ALWAYS use Obsidian's native design language and iconography**
- NO emojis - use clean SVG outline icons that match Obsidian's style
- Use ButtonComponent.setIcon() for all buttons and UI elements
- Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography with Obsidian
- Icons should use currentColor for theme compatibility
- Follow Obsidian's responsive design patterns for mobile/desktop

### Code Quality Principles
**ALWAYS strive for simple, clean, and maintainable code:**
- **Simplicity**: Remove unnecessary complexity, prefer straightforward solutions
- **Cleanliness**: No dead code, clear naming, consistent formatting
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **When refactoring**: Always simplify and clean up, don't just add features
- **Code reviews**: Ask "Is this the simplest way to solve this problem?"

## üéØ CURRENT PHASE: Ready for User Testing

### ‚úÖ All Critical Bugs Fixed

#### üêõ **Critical Bugs** - ALL FIXED ‚úÖ
- [x] Fix context removal error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')"
  - ‚úÖ Fixed stale references in context handling
  - ‚úÖ Added null-safe array operations in sidebar-view.ts
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced refreshContext() with better error handling
- [x] Fix cursor position preservation across file switches
  - ‚úÖ Implemented file-scoped cursor tracking (eliminates cross-file contamination)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed file-editor consistency for multi-document workflows
  - ‚úÖ Robust getActiveEditor() method ensures correct file targeting
  - ‚úÖ Command parser defaults 'add' to 'cursor' target
  - ‚úÖ Context builder optimized for cursor-only add commands

#### üìã **Completed Tasks** 
- [x] Fix test suite to work with cursor-only system (COMPLETE: 22/22 test files passing)
- [x] Remove all debug statements (COMPLETE: clean production build)
- [x] Fix .DS_Store git tracking (COMPLETE: added to .gitignore)

#### üéØ **Ready for User Testing**
**All critical technical work complete:**
- ‚úÖ Cursor-only transformation implemented and verified
- ‚úÖ Test suite completely updated (22/22 passing)
- ‚úÖ All critical bugs resolved
- ‚úÖ Clean production build (main.js: 289KB)
- ‚úÖ Documentation fully updated

### Next Phase: Pre-Testing Fixes & User Testing

#### üêõ **Critical UI Fixes Required Before Testing**
- [ ] **Fix Command Button & ":" System** - Align with Custom Commands feature design
  - Command button should only appear when Custom Commands feature is available (time-gated)
  - "Show Command Button in Chat" setting should be part of Custom Commands feature
  - When clicked, button should trigger the ":" command panel
  - ":" command list should be empty until user adds Custom Commands
  - Currently may show built-in editing commands that shouldn't be there
  - Should display "No custom commands yet" or similar empty state message
  - The entire ":" system is reserved for future Custom Commands feature

### ‚úÖ Completed Features Ready for Testing
- **File Picker Auto-Selection** - First item auto-selected, Enter key works immediately
- **Drag-and-Drop File Context** - Intuitive file addition via drag from file explorer

#### üìã **User Testing & Validation**
- [ ] User testing with cursor-only system
- [ ] Performance validation on target devices
- [ ] Final polish based on user feedback
- [ ] Prepare for market release
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ Build successful and stable

## Development Workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Progress Tracking
**Track PENDING work only in this CLAUDE.md file.**
**When work completes: REMOVE from here and APPEND to COMPLETED.md**
**Do NOT use TodoWrite/TodoRead or any other session-based tracking tools.**

### Making Changes
1. Focus on current phase tasks in order
2. One atomic change at a time only
3. **When tasks complete: REMOVE from CLAUDE.md and APPEND to COMPLETED.md**
4. **Add any new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section**
5. **Always prioritize code simplicity and maintainability**

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why
- **NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Always wait for user confirmation before committing and pushing

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

---

## Key Technical Patterns

### Core Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

## Remember
- MVP only - no extra features
- Working > Perfect  
- One atomic change at a time
- Build everything, gate for Supernova value
- **All completed work is archived in COMPLETED.md**
