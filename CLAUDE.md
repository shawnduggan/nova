# Nova - AI Thinking Partner for Obsidian

## BEHAVIORAL COMMANDS - READ FIRST

### MANDATORY RULES
**NEVER start responses with explanations or "I'll help you" - CODE IMMEDIATELY**
**ONE CHANGE PER RESPONSE** - If it involves multiple concerns, refuse and break it down
**WAIT FOR TEST CONFIRMATION** - After any fix, ask user to test before proceeding to next task
**NO AUTO-COMMITS** - Never commit unless explicitly commanded
**NO TODOS/STUBS** - Every function must work when implemented

### TDD PROTOCOL - MANDATORY
**SEQUENCE:**
1. Write failing test FIRST
2. Write minimal code to pass test
3. Use subagent to run test: `npm test -- filename.test.js`
4. State: "Test result: PASS/FAIL"
5. If FAIL: use subagent to investigate (lint, compile)
6. State: "Test this change. Type PASS or FAIL:"
7. STOP - wait for user response
8. If user says FAIL: debug, don't proceed
9. If user says PASS: ask "Next change?"

### SUBAGENT USAGE
**USE subagents for repetitive verification tasks:**
- Test execution: `npm test -- filename.test.js`
- TypeScript compilation: `tsc --noEmit`
- Linting: `eslint src/filename.ts`
- Build verification: `npm run build`
- File operations: reading/writing test files

**ALWAYS ask before using subagents for:**
- Git operations (already forbidden to auto-commit)
- Installing packages
- Modifying config files
- Any system-level changes

**SUBAGENT WORKFLOW:**
1. Write test + implementation
2. Use subagent to run test immediately
3. Report results: "Test passed/failed"
4. If failed: use subagent to investigate (lint, compile check)
5. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

### ATOMIC CHANGE DEFINITION
- ONE logical concern per response
- ONE function/component/test per response
- MUST fit in single git commit message
- User can understand the change in 30 seconds

**SIZE GUIDELINES:**
- Simple bug fix: 5-20 lines
- New function: 20-50 lines  
- New component: 30-80 lines
- Integration change: 40-100 lines
- **ABSOLUTE MAX: 100 lines per response**

### REJECTION CRITERIA
**TOO BIG if it involves:**
- Multiple unrelated files
- Multiple logical concerns
- Changes that affect multiple features
- "And also..." in the description

**COUNTER-OFFER:** "That's too big. Pick ONE specific change."

### ANTI-REFACTOR RULES
**ONLY modify code needed to pass the test**
**NEVER "improve" untested code**
**NEVER touch working code without explicit test**
**If you see "opportunities" - IGNORE THEM**

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**
- "While we're here..."
- "This would be cleaner if..."
- "Let me also fix..."
- "I noticed we could improve..."

**IF YOU MODIFY MORE THAN THE TEST REQUIRES:**
Immediately revert and respond: "I overstepped. Focusing only on: [test requirement]"

### SCOPE LOCKDOWN
**SCOPE TEST:** Can you describe this change in one sentence without "and"?
- GOOD: "Add validation to email input field"
- BAD: "Add validation to email and fix the styling and update the tests"

**REVERT TRIGGER:** If you find yourself changing something unrelated to the test, STOP immediately.

### REQUIRED RESPONSE STRUCTURE
```
[3 lines max describing the ONE change]

**Test:**
[Test code block]

**Implementation:**
[Implementation code block]

**Verification:**
[Subagent runs test automatically]
Test result: PASS/FAIL

Test this change. Type PASS or FAIL:
```
[STOP - no additional text]

### VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE STOP
If you catch yourself writing >100 lines, STOP MID-SENTENCE and say:
"This change is too big. Breaking into smaller pieces..."

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - Even if the user says "just do it all"
**NO NEGOTIATIONS** - Don't explain why, just enforce

### Design Guidelines
- **ALWAYS use Obsidian's native design language and iconography**
- NO emojis - use clean SVG outline icons that match Obsidian's style
- Use ButtonComponent.setIcon() for all buttons and UI elements
- Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography with Obsidian
- Icons should use currentColor for theme compatibility
- Follow Obsidian's responsive design patterns for mobile/desktop

### Code Quality Principles
**ALWAYS strive for simple, clean, and maintainable code:**
- **Simplicity**: Remove unnecessary complexity, prefer straightforward solutions
- **Cleanliness**: No dead code, clear naming, consistent formatting
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **When refactoring**: Always simplify and clean up, don't just add features
- **Code reviews**: Ask "Is this the simplest way to solve this problem?"

## 🎯 CURRENT PHASE: Ready for User Testing & Market Preparation - COMPLETE ✅

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Command Palette Cleanup & Mobile UX Enhancement**

#### **Native Selection-Based Command System** ✅
**Successfully replaced confusing commands with native selection actions:**

**Removed 5 problematic commands:**
- `nova-add-content` - Prompted "What would you like to add?" (confusing)
- `nova-edit-content` - Prompted "How would you like to edit?" (vague)  
- `nova-delete-content` - Prompted for deletion target (unclear)
- `nova-rewrite-content` - Prompted for rewrite instruction (vague)
- `nova-fix-grammar` - Prompted for input (inconsistent)

**Added 9 clean, direct-action commands:**
1. `Nova: Improve Writing` - Direct improvement action
2. `Nova: Make Longer` - Expand with detail
3. `Nova: Make Shorter` - Condense to essentials  
4. `Nova: Make Formal` - Professional tone
5. `Nova: Make Casual` - Conversational tone
6. `Nova: Make Academic` - Scholarly language
7. `Nova: Make Friendly` - Warm, approachable tone
8. `Nova: Tell Nova...` - Custom instruction modal
9. `Nova: Open Sidebar` - Utility command

**Key Achievements:**

## 📋 FUTURE PHASES (Lower Priority)

### **Phase 2: Market Readiness** (Next 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Business infrastructure
  - [ ] Landing page for novawriter.ai
  - [ ] Payment integration (Stripe/Paddle)
  - [ ] License key generation system
  - [ ] Customer support setup
- [ ] Distribution preparation
  - [ ] Obsidian Community Plugin submission
  - [ ] Marketing materials creation
  - [ ] Documentation site setup

### **Phase 2.5: Document-First UI Transformation** (HIGH PRIORITY - Future Session)

#### **Objective**
Transform Nova from a chat-first interface to a document-first collaborative writing partner that immediately understands context and provides actionable assistance.

#### **Core Principle**
**Remove the chatbot personality. Embrace the collaborative writing partner identity.**

#### **Interface Changes**

##### 1. Remove Redundant Branding
- **Remove:** "Hi! I'm Nova" greeting message
- **Remove:** "Nova" as document title when working on actual documents
- **Keep:** Small Nova logo/icon in corner for identification only
- **Replace:** Document title with actual document name being worked on

##### 2. Transform Input Placeholder
- **Remove:** "Ask Nova anything..." (reinforces chat paradigm)
- **Replace with:** "How can I help with your writing?" or "What would you like to do with this document?"

##### 3. Document-Centric Header
**Current:** "Nova" + "Working on '2025-06-15'"
**New Format:** "[Document Name]" + contextual info

```

```

#### **Contextual Information System**

##### On Chat Start, Display:
1. **Document Overview**
   - Title and basic stats (word count, character count)
   - Last modification time
   - Document type (if identifiable from templates/frontmatter)

2. **Structure Analysis**
   ```
   Document Structure:
   • Introduction (245 words) ✓
   • Background (156 words) ⚠️ Could expand
   • Analysis (Empty heading) ❌ Needs content
   • Recommendations (3 incomplete bullets) ⚠️
   • Conclusion (78 words) ✓
   ```

3. **Actionable Opportunities**
   - Incomplete sections (empty headings, placeholder text)
   - Thin sections (significantly shorter than others)
   - Incomplete thoughts (unfinished bullet points, TODO markers)
   - Orphaned content (isolated paragraphs, disconnected ideas)
   - Missing citations or incomplete links

4. **Related Context**
   - Linked documents in vault that might inform current document
   - Relevant tags or categories
   - Recent related documents worked on

#### **Implementation Requirements**

##### Document Analysis Functions
```javascript
// Analyze document structure
function analyzeDocumentStructure(content) {
  return {
    headings: extractHeadings(content),
    wordCounts: getWordCountBySection(content),
    incompleteElements: findIncompleteElements(content),
    orphanedContent: identifyOrphanedContent(content)
  }
}

// Find actionable opportunities
function findActionableOpportunities(analysis) {
  return {
    emptyHeadings: analysis.headings.filter(h => h.content.length === 0),
    thinSections: analysis.wordCounts.filter(s => s.words < averageWordCount * 0.5),
    incompleteBullets: findIncompleteBullets(analysis),
    todoItems: findTodoMarkers(analysis)
  }
}
```

##### Context Display Component

#### **Success Metrics**
- **Before:** User starts with empty chat, explains context
- **After:** Nova immediately understands document state and suggests specific improvements
- **Goal:** Zero setup time - Nova is ready to collaborate from first interaction

#### **Example New User Experience**

**User opens Nova on document "Marketing Strategy Draft"**

```
Marketing Strategy Draft
2,340 words • 8 sections • Last edited 30 minutes ago

Document overview:
• Executive Summary ✓ (234 words)
• Market Analysis ✓ (456 words)  
• Target Audience ⚠️ (89 words - could expand)
• Competitive Analysis (empty heading) ❌
• Marketing Tactics ⚠️ (3 incomplete bullet points)
• Budget & Timeline ✓ (234 words)
• Success Metrics ✓ (167 words)
• Conclusion ✓ (145 words)

I can help you:
• Draft the Competitive Analysis section
• Expand the Target Audience details
• Complete the Marketing Tactics bullets
• Suggest additional success metrics

What would you like to work on first?
```

**Input placeholder:** "How can I help with your writing?"

This transforms Nova from "another AI chat tool" into "a writing partner that already understands your work."

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (DEFERRED - Based on User Feedback)
- Enhanced / and : Command System (context panel integration)
- Templates system implementation
- Command usage analytics and smart sorting
- Usage insights dashboard
- Enterprise features development
- Advanced conversation management

### **Phase 4: Technical Debt & Architecture** (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Full Sidebar Refactoring** - Remove compatibility delegations in sidebar-view.ts
  - Replace 50+ legacy property references with direct component access
  - Systematic method-by-method refactoring required
  - Should be treated as dedicated architectural improvement task
  - Requires comprehensive testing after each component update

## Development Workflow

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Progress Tracking
**Track PENDING work only in this CLAUDE.md file.**
**When work completes: REMOVE from here and APPEND to COMPLETED.md**
**Do NOT use TodoWrite/TodoRead or any other session-based tracking tools.**

### Making Changes
1. Focus on current phase tasks in order
2. One atomic change at a time only
3. **When tasks complete: REMOVE from CLAUDE.md and APPEND to COMPLETED.md**
4. **Add any new bugs/tasks to the appropriate phase section**
5. **Always prioritize code simplicity and maintainability**

### Commit Messages
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" text to commits
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Focus on what was changed and why
- **NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Always wait for user confirmation before committing and pushing

### If Something Breaks
- Revert the last change
- Try a different approach
- Don't apologize, just fix

---

## Key Technical Patterns

### Core Patterns
- Use `app.vault.modify()` for all edits (undo support)
- Messages stored in `.obsidian/plugins/nova/conversations/[file-hash].json`
- All provider calls are async
- Platform.isDesktopApp determines provider

### Provider Interface
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
    complete(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string, options?: any): Promise<string>;
}
```

### Message Types
```typescript
type MessageRole = 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
interface ChatMessage {
    role: MessageRole;
    content: string;
    timestamp: number;
    command?: EditCommand;
    result?: EditResult;
}
```

---

## Remember
- MVP only - no extra features
- Working > Perfect  
- One atomic change at a time
- Build everything, gate for Supernova value
- **All completed work is archived in COMPLETED.md**
